# Screenshots Folder

This folder contains screenshots that support the project. These screenshots show the tools and results I used while doing the log analysis.

You should include:

1. **Event Viewer screenshots**  
   - Show where the Windows Security logs are found  
   - Show failed login attempts or other security events  

2. **PowerShell screenshots**  
   - Show simple log searches (for example: Get-EventLog)  
   - Show any log entries related to failed logins or unusual activity  

3. **Python script output**  
   - Screenshot of the terminal showing the suspicious IP report  
   - Screenshot of the script running with no errors  

These screenshots help prove how the analysis was done and what results were found.
