Findings

The Python script processed the apache_access.log file from the data folder. The log contained a total of 4 unique IP addresses. Most of the IPs had normal behavior, but two of them showed patterns that may be related to unauthorized access.

IP address 203.0.113.55  
  – Total requests: 9  
  – Failed or error responses: 9  
  – Failure ratio: 1.00  
  This IP had a complete failure rate. Every request returned an error. This is a strong sign of a brute-force attempt or repeated login failure.

IP address 198.51.100.23  
  – Total requests: 5  
  – Failed or error responses: 4  
  – Failure ratio: 0.80  
  This IP attempted multiple actions that failed. A high failure rate like this often means someone is probing pages, guessing credentials, or scanning for weaknesses.

These two IPs match the type of suspicious activity seen in real intrusion attempts, where attackers test login forms or restricted pages.

 Windows Security Log Findings
Windows Security logs were reviewed through Event Viewer and PowerShell. Using the PowerShell command “Get-EventLog -LogName Security -Newest 20”, it showed me recent Security log entries. These logs included several Audit Success events related to Credential Manager reading entries, which is normal background activity.

From Event Viewer, multiple Event ID 4625 (failed logon attempt) (only one in screenshot) was also found. This indicates that at least one failed login attempt occurred on the system. A 4625 event is important because it shows an account failed to log in. While this may come from a user mistyping a password, it can also be a sign of a forced attempt.

Using both PowerShell output and Event Viewer logs shows that Windows Security logging is active and capturing authentication activity on the system.


Both the Apache and Windows logs show the value of basic log review. The Apache log revealed two IP addresses with high failure rates, which can point to possible brute-force attempts or scanning behavior. The Windows logs had a failed login event (4625) and normal credential activity, which shows that the system is recording authentication events correctly.

These findings support the idea that even simple log analysis can help detect early signs of unauthorized access. Patterns in log files often reveal suspicious behavior before a serious issue happens.

Recommendations:
- Review any IP addresses that show many failed or error responses.  
- Monitor Event Viewer regularly for 4625 failed login events.  
- Set alerts or notifications for repeated login failures.  
- Use stronger passwords and consider enabling account lockout rules.  
- Keep access logs and security logs organized so they can be reviewed quickly when needed.
